    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
        programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
        support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can
        run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
        similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
        capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
        compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
        GitHub,[citation not found][19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million
        developers.[21]

        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core
        component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
        machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in
        compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java
        technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the
        official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most
        developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

        As of March 2023, Java 20 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS)
        versions.
        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
        with the use of significant indentation.[34]

        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
        "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[35][36]

        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and
        first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[37] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008,
        was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020,
        was the last release of Python 2.[38]

        Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")[4] is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web
        application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.
        Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

        Differences between Angular and AngularJS

        Architecture of an Angular application. The main building blocks are modules, components, templates, metadata,
        data binding, directives, services, and dependency injection.
        Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.

        Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers; instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its
        primary architectural characteristic.[5]
        Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event
        binding[6]
